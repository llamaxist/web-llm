# Web LLM

| [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-llm) | [Get Started](#get-started) | [Examples](examples) | [Documentation](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/docs/deploy/javascript.html) | [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm) | [Discord][discord-url] |

WebLLM is a modular and customizable javascript package that directly
brings language model chats directly onto web browsers with hardware acceleration.
**Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and is accelerated with WebGPU.**

**WebLLM is fully compatible with [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat).**
That is, you can use the same OpenAI API on **any open source models** locally, with functionalities
including json-mode, function-calling, streaming, etc.

We can bring a lot of fun opportunities to build AI assistants for everyone and enable privacy while enjoying GPU acceleration.

**[Check out our demo webpage to try it out!](https://webllm.mlc.ai/)**
You can use WebLLM as a base [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mlc-ai/web-llm) and build your own web application on top of it by following the [documentation](https://mlc.ai/mlc-llm/docs/deploy/javascript.html) and checking out [Get Started](#get-started).
This project is a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm),
which runs LLMs natively on iPhone and other native local environments.

## Get Started

WebLLM offers a minimalist and modular interface to access the chatbot in the browser.
The WebLLM package itself does not come with UI, and is designed in a
modular way to hook to any of the UI components. The following code snippet
demonstrate a simple example that generates a streaming response on a webpage.
You can check out [examples/get-started](examples/get-started/) to see the complete example.

```typescript
import * as webllm from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

async function main() {
  const initProgressCallback = (report: webllm.InitProgressReport) => {
    const label = document.getElementById("init-label");
    label.innerText = report.text;
  };
  const selectedModel = "Llama-3-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1";
  const engine: webllm.EngineInterface = await webllm.CreateEngine(
    selectedModel,
    /*engineConfig=*/{ initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback }
  );

  const reply0 = await engine.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [{ "role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Pittsburgh." }]
  });
  console.log(reply0);
  console.log(await engine.runtimeStatsText());
}

main();
```

Note that if you need to separate the instantiation of `webllm.Engine` from loading a model, you could substitute

```typescript
const engine: webllm.EngineInterface = await webllm.CreateEngine(
  selectedModel,
  /*engineConfig=*/{ initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback }
);
```

with the equivalent

```typescript
const engine: webllm.EngineInterface = new webllm.Engine();
engine.setInitProgressCallback(initProgressCallback);
await engine.reload(selectedModel, chatConfig, appConfig);
```

### Using Web Worker

WebLLM comes with API support for WebWorker so you can hook
the generation process into a separate worker thread so that
the compute in the webworker won't disrupt the UI.

We first create a worker script that created a Engine and
hook it up to a handler that handles requests.

```typescript
// worker.ts
import { EngineWorkerHandler, Engine } from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

// Hookup an Engine to a worker handler
const engine = new Engine();
const handler = new EngineWorkerHandler(engine);
self.onmessage = (msg: MessageEvent) => {
  handler.onmessage(msg);
};
```

Then in the main logic, we create a `WebWorkerEngine` that
implements the same `EngineInterface`. The rest of the logic remains the same.

```typescript
// main.ts
import * as webllm from "@mlc-ai/web-llm";

async function main() {
  // Use a WebWorkerEngine instead of Engine here
  const engine: webllm.EngineInterface = await webllm.CreateWebWorkerEngine(
    /*worker=*/new Worker(
      new URL('./worker.ts', import.meta.url),
      { type: 'module' }
    ),
    /*modelId=*/selectedModel,
    /*engineConfig=*/{ initProgressCallback: initProgressCallback }
  );
  // everything else remains the same
}
```

### Build a ChatApp

You can find a complete chat app example in [examples/simple-chat](examples/simple-chat/).

### Chrome Extension

You can also find examples on building chrome extension with WebLLM in [examples/chrome-extension](examples/chrome-extension/) and [examples/chrome-extension-webgpu-service-worker](examples/chrome-extension-webgpu-service-worker/). The latter one leverages service worker, so the extension is persisten in the background.

## Full OpenAI Compatibility

WebLLM is designed to be fully compatible with [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat). Thus, besides building simple chat bot, you can also have the following functionalities with WebLLM:

- [streaming](examples/streaming): return output as chunks in real-time in the form of an AsyncGenerator
- [json-mode](examples/json-mode): efficiently ensure output is in json format, see [OpenAI Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api) for more.
- [function-calling](examples/function-calling): function calling with fields `tools` and `tool_choice`.
- [seed-to-reproduce](examples/seed-to-reproduce): use seeding to ensure reproducible output with fields `seed`.

## Model Support

We export all supported models in `webllm.prebuiltAppConfig`, where you can see a list of models
that you can simply call `const engine: webllm.EngineInterface = await webllm.CreateEngine(anyModel)` with.
Prebuilt models include:

- Llama-2
- Gemma
- Phi-1.5 and Phi-2
- Mistral-7B-Instruct
- OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B
- NeuralHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B
- TinyLlama
- RedPajama

Alternatively, you can compile your own model and weights as described below.

WebLLM works as a companion project of [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).
It reuses the model artifact and builds flow of MLC LLM, please check out
[MLC LLM document](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/javascript.html)
on how to add new model weights and libraries to WebLLM.

Here, we go over the high-level idea. There are two elements of the WebLLM package that enables new models and weight variants.

- `model_url`: Contains a URL to model artifacts, such as weights and meta-data.
- `model_lib_url`: A URL to the web assembly library (i.e. wasm file) that contains the executables to accelerate the model computations.

Both are customizable in the WebLLM.

```typescript
async main() {
  const appConfig = {
    "model_list": [
      {
        "model_url": "/url/to/my/llama",
        "model_id": "MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0"
        "model_lib_url": "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",
      }
    ],
  };
  // override default
  const chatOpts = {
    "repetition_penalty": 1.01
  };

  const chat = new ChatModule();
  // load a prebuilt model
  // with a chat option override and app config
  // under the hood, it will load the model from myLlamaUrl
  // and cache it in the browser cache
  // The chat will also load the model library from "/url/to/myllama3b.wasm",
  // assuming that it is compatible to the model in myLlamaUrl.
  const engine = await webllm.CreateEngine(
    "MyLlama-3b-v1-q4f32_0", 
    /*engineConfig=*/{ chatOpts: chatOpts, appConfig: appConfig }
  );
}
```

In many cases, we only want to supply the model weight variant, but
not necessarily a new model (e.g. `NeuralHermes-Mistral` can reuse `Mistral`'s
model library). For examples on how a model library can be shared by different model variants,
see `prebuiltAppConfig`.

## Build WebLLM Package From Source

NOTE: you don't need to build by yourself unless you would
like to change the WebLLM package. To simply use the npm, follow [Get Started](#get-started) or any of the [examples](examples) instead.

WebLLM package is a web runtime designed for [MLC LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm).

1. Install all the prerequisites for compilation:

- [emscripten](https://emscripten.org). It is an LLVM-based compiler that compiles C/C++ source code to WebAssembly.
  - Follow the [installation instruction](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended) to install the latest emsdk.
  - Source `emsdk_env.sh` by `source path/to/emsdk_env.sh`, so that `emcc` is reachable from PATH and the command `emcc` works.
- Install jekyll by following the [official guides](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). It is the package we use for website. This is not needed if you're using nextjs (see next-simple-chat in the examples).
- Install jekyll-remote-theme by command. Try [gem mirror](https://gems.ruby-china.com/) if install blocked.

  ```shell
  gem install jekyll-remote-theme
  ```

We can verify the successful installation by trying out `emcc` and `jekyll` in terminal, respectively.

2. Clone the source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mlc-ai/web-llm.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd web-llm
```

3. Setup necessary environment

Prepare all the necessary dependencies for web build:

```shell
export TVM_HOME=$(pwd)/3rdparty/tvm
nvm use --lts # use the latest NodeJs
./scripts/prep_deps.sh
```

4. Build WebLLM Package

```shell
npm run build
```

5. Validate some of the sub-packages

You can then go to the subfolders in [examples](examples) to validate some of the sub-packages.
We use Parcelv2 for bundling. Although Parcel is not very good at tracking parent directory
changes sometimes. When you make a change in the WebLLM package, try to edit the `package.json`
of the subfolder and save it, which will trigger Parcel to rebuild.
